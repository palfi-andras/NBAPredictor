NBAPredictor Source Code
------------------------
By: Andras Palfi

This program has the ability to try to predict the outcome of previous NBA Games using either a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
 or a Support Vector Machine (SVM). To date, it the programs best model has been able to achieve a 73% accuracy on
 predicting a subset of games in the 2017-2018 season. It allows users to run experiments in a very modular way, allowing
 the user to change options such as the years of NBA data that should be tested/trained on, which method to use (DNN or SVM),
 the learning rate, and much more. The full list of configurable options are outlined in the projects config file
 (./NBAPredictor/resource/config.ini).

The project has the following dependencies:
